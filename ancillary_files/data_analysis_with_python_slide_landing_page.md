# Data Analysis with Python Course

The course is free to attend for anyone at the LMB.  Further details of the course are given below:

Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that can be used to analyse large and complex datasets.  Whether you're collating results, performing statistical tests or investigating gene expression matrices, this course will equip you with the core skills to analyse biological data sets.

Topics include:

* Manipulating data using the pandas library

* Plotting figures

* Introducing Python libraries for mathematical and statistical analyses

* Documenting and sharing results with Jupyter Notebooks

By the end of the course, attendees should understand how to handle and investigate large datasets using Python.  And although we can't cover every form of analysis in the course, the topics covered will make a good starting point for your own studies.

The course will be run periodically throughout the year, and the course documentation is available at any time online:
